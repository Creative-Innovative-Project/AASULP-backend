            i am developing application that helps a university student by creating roadmaps for him, each course to help him prepare through out the semester. i have this syllabus for our entire program above. This is how it works, each time a student starts a semester by clicking a button in our semester, you will have the start and end of semester, also the Exams in between. You need to prepare a roadmap for each Course in that Semester, including all the Exams in Between, plan the roadmap has Weeks, within each Weeks there will be many Topics, There is a Quiz after each Week. the Roadmap must be within the Semester Period. Now i will give the database schema for the models in my application i have set.

            Just read it and follow that to create functions.

            description - string

            now if a user starts a semester, you need to give me the roadmap for all courses in the semester as a json file, also the weeks, exams in the courses, also the topics in each weeks. The rank attribute in week and exam helps to depict the order in which they will be ordered when combined, the three exams - Assessment I and Assessment II and Final End Semester, the Assessment II and End Semester should be at the final, the Assessment I should be in the middle of the weeks. The rank attribute helps to determine where to place an exam in between weeks, no two weeks or exams can have the same rank.

            Make sure the spelling are followed just as i gave for exam types, course types, and all enum attributes
